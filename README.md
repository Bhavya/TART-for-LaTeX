The TART class was initially written to format reports for the ECE 455 and ECE 429 courses at the University of Waterloo, in Waterloo, Ontario. The last time the TART class was updated was May 20, 2012. The class was written using MiKTeX, an implementation of TEX for Windows, and Sublime Text 2, a simple text editor with tabs and syntax highlighting.
